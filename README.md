### Hola ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer based in the North East, UK. I have a range of experience in SaaS products, migrations, e-commerce, payments and publishing.

### Need help with open source project?

I'm currently looking for a open source project to get my teeth stuck into. I have a lot to thank the open source community for and want to dedicate a portion of my time to working in the open.

### Hire me

I help organisations solve real-world problems using modern, innovative, web-based solutions. I offer services end to end; front end, to back end, to helping improve your workflows and tooling. Suppose your organisation needs a reliable web development resource, and you want to avoid going through the costs and hassle of hiring additional help in-house, I may be a good option for you.
